Hören übung mit spaß-- for german classes and practice
This was inspired when our teacher played a song in our german class and gave us a paper of the lyrics of the song with missing texts. We had to listen to the song and fill the lyrics. It was a fun Hören exercise. Link to the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJGaSexAelo
Song name: Ben Zucker - Mein Berlin  - Single Mix.
